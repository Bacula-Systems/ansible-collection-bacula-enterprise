      - changed the repository format created by the roles bee, bee_fdonly, bee_sdonly,
        bee_sdplugin and bee_fdplugin to use the DEB822 source format. This change
        will impact the use of the collection to update the hosts, as they should
        be using the One-Line-Style format used by previous collections.
